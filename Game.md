###Exposition: The Quest Begins
An old master on his deathbed hires a group of adventurers to retrieve a legendary, ancient treasure from a faraway temple and restore it with his disciple within a month's time. The adventurers consist of a mathematician, scholar, engineer, artist, and scientist. After a week-long journey, the adventurers arrive at the temple's entrance.

Challenge: Solve a puzzle to unlock the temple's doors.
- Mathematician: solves numeric pattern/equation from a sequence of glowing runes
- Scholar: There is a verse from an ancient poem written in a dead language inscribed on the wall next to the door. The scholar translates and recites the correct verse.
- Engineer: Repairs a broken gear mechanism with scrap metal and improvised tools.
- Artist: Correctly pieces together a broken mural and restores the image
- Scientist: Applies a chemical solution to weaken lock mechanism

###Rising Action: Into the Temple
The adventurers explore the temple, learning its history, culture, and ancient religion. They eventually find a hidden room in the temple that is guarded by an ancient deity's spirit.

Challenge: Using their newfound knowledge, answer the deity's riddles to gain access to the hidden chamber, where the ancient treasure lies.
- Three riddles, identifying past, present, and future.
- Past: What was lost when the crimson moon wept?
  - Scholar: Recalls the history of the temple's fall
  - Artist: Interprets murals showing the tale of the temple
- Present: What force binds the breath of stones?
  - Scientist: Identifies subterranean gases
  - Engineer: Detects temple's hidden ventilation system
-Future: What dawn will crown the sleepless throne?
  - Mathematician: Calculates the time that the next heir of the ancient temple's people will be born.

###Climax: The Ancient Treasure
The adventurers obtain the treasure. However, the temple starts collapsing when they remove the treasure from its resting place. The adventurers escape just in time. However, the way back home is filled with monsters, attracted by the treasure and wanting it for themselves

Challenge: Find a way to ward off the monsters while safely transporting the treasure back home.
- Mathematician: calculates time and path for the most optimal way home.
- Scholar: Recalls information about the monsters from the temple's historical texts
- Engineer: Builds traps for the monsters
- Artist: Fashions a bag to carry and hide the treasure in
- Scientist: Analyzes the treasure's energy and masks its influence

###Falling Action: The Blocked Path
On their way home, the adventurers find that their usual path has been blocked. They decide to go another route, where they face a fork in the road. One way is more treacherous but faster, while the other way is safer but takes longer. The adventurers only have 2 weeks to return the treasure.

Challenge: Figure out which path home is the most convenient. There is a time pressure involved.
- Mathematician: calculates the pros and cons of each path (time taken, risks, odds of survival, etc., etc.)
- Scholar: Cites historical legends about either paths, which reveals pros and cons of each
- Engineer: Builds mechanisms (e.g. armor, tools, weapons) to speed up or ease difficulties of travel
- Artist: Designs mechanisms for faster/easier travel
- Scientist: Analyzes environment to aid in survival or travel (e.g., rock stability, wind patterns, edible plants, distilling drinkable water)

###Resolution: Homecoming
The adventurers finally make it home and deliver the treasure to the old master's disciple. However, the disciple in question is an imposter! The real disciple is bound nearby, and time is running out to restore the treasure.

Challenge: Defeat the imposter, save the real disciple, restore the treasure.
- Mathematician: determines the right numerical lock sequence to rescue real disciple
- Scholar: Notices something wrong with the "disciple" (e.g., imposter isn't wearing their special symbol, imposter is quoting restoration ritual incorrectly, etc., etc.)
- Engineer: Disarms traps surrounding real disciple
- Artist: Helps real disciple draw ritual circle, allowing disciple to successfully complete the restoration of the treasure.
- Scientist: Makes compounds that disorient or attack the imposter (smokescreen, blinding lights, etc., etc.)
